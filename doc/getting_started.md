# Getting started

[TOC]

This page shows how to run a first problem after the @ref installation.md is
completed.

# The VAC problem

Traditionally, the first test problem is the VAC advection located in
`amrvac/tests/rho/vac`. Two files are present in this folder:

* `mod_usr.t`: the user code for this problem (defining e.g. initial conditions)
* `amrvac.par`: a text file with settings

# Compilation {#vac_compilation}

In the vac test folder, run the setup script with:

    setup.pl -d=2

This will copy a makefile to the current folder, set the problem dimension
to two, and use the default compiler settings, which is gfortran with openMPI.
To select different compiler settings (present in `amrvac/arch/`)
you could for example use:

    setup.pl -d=2 -arch=intel
    setup.pl -d=2 -arch=debug

You can also edit the `makefile` directly.

Then it is time to compile the code:

    make -j 4

This will perform a parallel compilation using 4 cores. First, the AMRVAC
library is compiled in `amrvac/lib/` if it is not available already. This
is the generic part of AMRVAC that does not depend on your user code. Then your
user code is also compiled, and an executable binary file called `amrvac` is produced.

There are a couple of useful commands to know about:

    make clean        # clean the local object files
    make ARCH=debug   # do a debug build (extra error checking)
    make ARCH=<name>  # use the compilation flags from arch/<name>.defs
    make allclean     # clean the local object files and the AMRVAC library

# Running the test {#vac_run}

To run the test problem on 4 cores:

    mpirun -np 4 ./amrvac -i amrvac.par

This will run amrvac with parameter-file amrvac.par. Then you have several new
files ending in `.dat`, `.vtu` and one `.log` file. The `.dat` files are used
for restarts and the `.vtu` files contain the output data to be visualized.

# Visualization {#visualization}

Simulation output in `.vtu` (VTK unstructured) format can directly be
visualized [Paraview](http://www.paraview.org/)
or [Visit](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit).

Visualization or analysis of the results can also be done by
converting `.dat` files to e.g., Tecplot, or VTK native formats.
This requires the same amrvac executable used to run the simulation.
Using a csh script tool `aiconvert` in amrvac/tools folder, users can convert
to a format defined by **convert_type** parameter in the _filelist_ of an input 
par file:

    aiconvert

to convert all `.dat` files related to amrvac.par file, or

    aiconvert 10 20

from snapshot 10 to 20, or

    aiconvert YOUR.par 0 20

to convert snapshot 0 to 20 related to YOUR.par file.
You can find more information at [convert](@ref convert.md) page.
