1. Figure out the cell center position of the very first cell in the simulation space (ie not a ghost cell)
2. Feed this information in the compute_solution_for_any_gamma.f90 file along with :
  - the number of cells
  - the inner and outer radii
  - the adiabatic index (for gamma=1, take 1.00001d0)
  - whether we work with a stretched grid or not
3. Then, compile and run to produce iniState.dat, the initial state.
   It also provides the rho values in the outer ghost cells, to be copied in the mod_usr.t file
4. Give in mod_usr.t the position of the very first cell (see 1.) along with the values in the outer ghost cells (see 3.)

Experiment with different adiabatic indexes, different resolution, with or without stretching, with or without AMR, etc
