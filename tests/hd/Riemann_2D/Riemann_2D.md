# Riemannd 2D test problem

# Introduction

These are 2D Riemann problems as also in Liska & Wendro , SIAM J. Sci. Comput.
25, 3, pp. 995-1017, 2003 (section 4.4). You can try to modify the setups, or
compare different schemes. This is a direct generalization of the 1D Riemann
problem discussed in the course, so you can try and interpret 1D versus 2D
aspects (involving shocks, contact discontinuities, rarefaction waves). You can
also make a 3D version.

# How to run

## Setting up the files

    $AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -d=2

## Compiling

Simply issue the `make` command:

    make

## Running the code

To run with e.g. 4 processors, use

    mpirun -np 4 ./amrvac -i rm_2d.par

# Changing the parameters

A complete list of parameters can be found [par.md](par.md).

# Changing the physics and initial conditions

Have a look at the local file `mod_usr.t`. You can modify the 
initial conditions easily.
