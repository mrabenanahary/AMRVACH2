This version of the MPI-AMRVAC software was initiated in the course of 2006-2007
by [Bart van der Holst](http://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/bartvand/FACULTY) in
collaboration with [Rony Keppens](http://perswww.kuleuven.be/~u0016541) at
the
[Centre for mathematical Plasma-Astrophysics (CmPA)](https://wis.kuleuven.be/CmPA) at
K.U.Leuven. The code has some heritage (in the solver part) to
the [Versatile Advection Code ](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gtoth) or VAC,
initiated by Gabor Toth at the Astronomical Institute at Utrecht in November
1994, with help from Rony Keppens since 1996.

MPI-AMRVAC is currently developed by:

* **Chun Xia** as a core developer
* **Jannis Teunissen** as a core developer

Past contributors to MPI-AMRVAC are:

* **Zakaria Meliani** was a core developer (relativistic physics modules,
  parallel I/O, postprocessing formats)
* **Oliver Porth** was a core developer
* **Allard Jan van Marle** (optically thin radiative loss treatments)
* **Peter Delmont** (visualization capabilities)
* A number of users at CmPA and abroad

The work benefitted from funding by K.U.Leuven GOA/2009/009; FWO project
G.0277.08; and FP7 project [SWIFF](http://swiff.eu).
